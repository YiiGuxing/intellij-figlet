flf2a 4 3 8 15 11 0 10127 242
Bubble by Glenn Chappell 4/93
Includes characters 128-255
Enhanced for Latin-2,3,4 by John Cowan <cowan@ccil.org>
Latin character sets supported only if your screen font does
figlet release 2.2 -- November 1996
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.
